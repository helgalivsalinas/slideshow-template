<p>“‘Wow, that’s great dad.’ I doubt they completely understand. They know it’s a  position of authority. They know that my brother-in-law walks around with a handgun very infrequently. They know it’s honorable, respectable,” says the source referring to his children's reactions when he explained his possible career change.</p>

<p>“My wife is a banker. I don’t think she’s ever been as supportive with anything as she has with this,” said our source. “She’s done the cost and benefit analysis. She knows things are going to get better for us. Yeah, I might be gone a lot more but  we’ll finish getting out of debt sooner, putting money away for the kid’s school much quicker. She knows it’s a good thing.”</p>
